# Backend — Code Style Guidelines

- Formatter: **Prettier + ESLint (Airbnb base)**
- Organize imports by group: core → third-party → local
- Functions and classes must be **small and cohesive** (max 40 lines)
- Naming conventions:
  - Files → kebab-case
  - Classes → PascalCase
  - Variables/functions → camelCase
- Every endpoint must return DTOs validated via `class-validator`
- Use `HttpException` or custom errors — never throw generic errors
- Prefer `async/await` over callbacks or `.then()`
- All major controllers / services must include **Jest unit tests**
- `any` type is forbidden — use explicit types or proper generics
```
