# Signal Ops — Dev Workflow

- Use **Docker Compose** to spin up the full observability stack:
```

docker compose up -d

```
- Branching strategy:
- `main` → production
- `dev` → development
- `feature/*` → new features
- Commit messages follow **Conventional Commits**:
- `feat: add OTEL collector config`
- `fix: grafana dashboard import issue`
- Pull Requests must include:
- Clear description of changes
- Screenshot of affected dashboards (if applicable)
- Passing tests (`npm run test`)
- CI/CD (future): validate build, lint, and test before merge
```
